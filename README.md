# OpenModal
OpenModal is an open source experimental modal analysis software written in Python.

OpenModal combines geometry builder, measurement, identification and animation module to aid in experimental analysis of the dynamic properties of structures. It is written in Python and published under the GPL license.

## Running the software
In order to develop the software on the same Python version and the corresponding library versions,
a virtual environment is created in the folder *virtual-environment*.

To run the virtual environment on Windows PowerShell, execute the following commands:

```
.\virtual-environment\Scripts\Activate.ps1
```

This should set the environment to `Python 3.6` and to the `PyQt4` and the associated librraries.

To run the software, execute the following:

```
cd openModal/
python openmodal.py
```
